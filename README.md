# Quartic-Ohno-Nakagawa
Files needed in the computer-assisted proof of the quartic Ohno-Nakagawa reflection theorem (see arxiv.org/abs/2107.04727)

To run the proof verification, your computer must have Sage >= 9.0 (sagemath.org) and LattE integrale >= 1.7.5 (math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/)

The proof can be verified by loading the file "main.sage". It takes a few hours to run (on my Intel i7 running Linux Mint.)
